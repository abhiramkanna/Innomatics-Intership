Logic Building Task – 1 (Python)
Overview
This repository contains basic logic-building problems implemented in Python. The purpose of this task is to strengthen foundational programming concepts, such as:

-Conditional statements -Loops -Lists -String manipulation -Basic data analysis

These problems simulate real-world scenarios to improve problem-solving skills.

Problems Included

User Login Check
-Validates username and password. -Prints login success or invalid credentials. -Real-world use: Authentication systems.

Student Result Analysis
-Counts pass and fail students. -Pass condition: marks ≥ 50. -Real-world use: Academic evaluation systems.

Name Cleaning & Standardization
-Removes extra spaces. -Converts names to lowercase. -Real-world use: Data preprocessing.

Message Size Analysis
-Calculates message length. -Flags messages longer than 10 characters. -Real-world use: Text validation systems.

Error Log Detection
-Counts the number of "ERROR" entries. -Real-world use: Monitoring and log analysis systems.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

-Basic built-in functions (len(), count(), strip(), lower())

Learning Outcome

After completing this task, I improved my understanding of:

-Writing clean and structured code -Implementing conditional logic -Iterating through lists -Performing basic data validation
